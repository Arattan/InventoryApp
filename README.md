#InventoryApp was an assessed course project of the Data Storage component of the Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program.

The app allows a retail store to track its inventory of products and to related information about each item, such as price, quantity, supplier information and a picture of a product. Further it allows the user to manually update sales and shipment data and to directly order more stock from the listed supplier if required.
